# 👋 Hi, I'm David Ortiz

## 🎯 Cybersecurity Professional | Penetration Testing Enthusiast | AI Security Researcher

I'm a cybersecurity student at WGU pursuing offensive security with a unique focus on bridging traditional pentesting with AI security challenges. Currently preparing for the PNPT certification while building practical tools that automate and enhance security testing workflows.

### 🛡️ What I Do

- 🔴 **Offensive Security**: Daily practice on HTB, PNPT labs, and custom vulnerable environments
- 🤖 **AI Security Research**: Building tools that leverage AI for recon, vulnerability analysis, and exploit development
- 🔵 **Purple Team Mindset**: Understanding both attack and defense for more impactful security assessments
- 🛠️ **Automation**: Creating Python tools that reduce manual testing time by 70%+

### 📜 Certifications
- ✅ CompTIA Security+
- ✅ CompTIA Network+
- ✅ CompTIA A+
- ✅ Linux Essentials
- ✅ CCNA
- 🎯 PNPT (In Progress - Target: July 2025)

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🍯 [Azure Honeynet & SOC Lab](https://github.com/RazonIn4K/Azure-Honeynet-SOC)
Purple team project where I:
- Deployed vulnerable Azure infrastructure attracting 20,000+ real attacks
- Analyzed attack patterns and TTPs from global threat actors
- Achieved 96-100% security score through systematic remediation
- Created detailed attack visualizations and incident response documentation

#### 🔧 Offensive Security Automation Suite
Collection of 15+ custom tools including:
